# Real Estate Portal
This project focuses on creating a real estate portal that facilitates users in searching, comparing, and managing property listings. The system will enable users to access detailed information on properties, including descriptions, and essential features, to aid in their decision-making process. Users can list their properties, providing necessary details to attract potential buyers. The system will also offer a comparison tool allowing the evaluation of properties side by side based on various criteria.
